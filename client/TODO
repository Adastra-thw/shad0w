1. Fix cookie auth
	- since electron hosts the app using file:/// instead of an IP address the cookies won't set.  Resolve this.
2. Finish adding agents and agent panels
3. Finish designs.  Remove old Jyang branding, make it shad0w compatible.
4. Pass CORS IP through an argument
5. Fetch doesn't like self signed.  Make SSL an argument.
